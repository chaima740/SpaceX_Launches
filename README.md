Analysis and Prediction of SpaceX launches outcome


<i> Objective: Forecasting the success of the next launch. </i>

One of SpaceX's secrets to make space travel affordable is savings. As a matter of fact, rocket launches are relatively inexpensive because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the rocket which does most of the work. Therefore, we can determine if the first stage will land through data analysis and forecasting to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage and thus determine the price of each launch.
